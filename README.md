===========

We are a small team of biologists, animators and programmers based at Harvard Medical School seeking to change the way biologists create and visualize molecular models.

The Molecular FlipBook Project has two main goals:

    We will create a comprehensive, free and open-source molecular animation software toolkit, Molecular Flipbook, that has been specifically designed with the needs of biology researchers in mind.

    We will develop a website that will allow members of the research and education communities to freely share, view, and edit molecular models with one another.
